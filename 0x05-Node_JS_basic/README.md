NodeJS Basics
Topics aim was understanding the following concepts:

run javascript using NodeJS
use NodeJS modules
use specific Node JS module to read files
use process to access command line arguments and the environment
create a small HTTP server using Node JS
create a small HTTP server using Express JS
create advanced routes with Express JS
use ES6 with Node JS with Babel-node
use Nodemon to develop faster
Files
database.csv

package.json

babel.config.js

.eslintrc.js

Task 0
Function named displayMessage that prints in STDOUT the string argument.

0-console.js

Task 1
Program named 1-stdin.js that will be executed through command line:

It should display the message Welcome to Holberton School, what is your name? (followed by a new line)
The user should be able to input their name on a new line
The program should display Your name is: INPUT
When the user ends the program, it should display This important software is now closing (followed by a new line)
1-stdin.js

Task 2
Contains method that reads from a file database.csv synchronously and returns the content of the file as a string.

2-read-file.js

Task 3
Contains method that reads from a file database.csv asynchronously and returns the content of the file as a string.

3-read_file_async.js

Task 4
Create a small HTTP server using the http module:

It should be assigned to the variable app and this one must be exported
HTTP server should listen on port 1245
Displays Hello Holberton School! in the page body for any endpoint as plain text
4-http.js

Task 5
Create a small HTTP server using the http module:

It should be assigned to the variable app and this one must be exported
HTTP server should listen on port 1245
It should return plain text
When the URL path is /, it should display Hello Holberton School! in the page body
When the URL path is /students, it should display This is the list of our students followed by the same content as the file 3-read_file_async.js (with and without the database) - the name of the database must be passed as argument of the file
5-http.js

Task 6
Create a small HTTP server using Express module:

It should be assigned to the variable app and this one must be exported
HTTP server should listen on port 1245
Displays Hello Holberton School! in the page body for the endpoint /
6-http_express.js

Task 7
Recreate the small HTTP server using Express module:

It should be assigned to the variable app and this one must be exported
HTTP server should listen on port 1245
It should return plain text
When the URL path is /, it should display Hello Holberton School! in the page body
When the URL path is /students, it should display This is the list of our students followed by the same content as the file 3-read_file_async.js (with and without the database) - the name of the database must be passed as argument of the file
7-http_express.js

Task 8
Obviously writing every part of a server within a single file is not sustainable. Let’s create a full server in a directory named full_server.

Since you have used ES6 and Babel in the past projects, let’s use babel-node to allow to use ES6 functions like import or export.
